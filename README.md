# Search Engine Project

## Overview

The goal of the project was to create a simple search engine that indexes web pages and allows users to search for keywords within those pages.

## Features

- **Indexing:** The search engine crawls through a set of web pages and indexes the content.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for keywords, and the search engine returns a list of pages that contain those keywords.
- **Ranking:** Search results are ranked based on the frequency of the search term within each page.
- **Responsive Design:** The user interface is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.
